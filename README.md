# theVaultBASIC2.0
An updated and downgraded version of theVaultC, now in BASIC 2.0. Available for the Commodore 64, and possibly other Commodore computers.
### The (new!) greatest jumble of C64 BASIC 2.0 shenanigans around.
And yes, all for the C64. All projects contained in theVaultBASIC2.0 are guaranteed to work on the C64. Somewhat compatible with other CBM computers, however a some of the code used does not work under other machines, so the level of support varies by project.
## Compiling and Running
#### Compiling:
The built programs will be stored in the same directory as the source code, but you can build the source code if you really want.
Download CBM prg Studio. Open the `.cbmprj` file with `CBM prg Studio`, nagvigate to the `.bas` for the program you want, then select `build/program/and run` from the bar at the top.
#### Running: 
You can open the `.prg` and `.d64` files with [Vice](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io), or, if you don't want to download stuff, [lvllvl](lvllvl.com/c64).



I stole theVaultC's readme.
